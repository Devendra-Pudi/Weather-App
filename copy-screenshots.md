# Screenshot Copy Instructions

To properly display the screenshots in the README.md file, please follow these steps:

1. Save the first screenshot (showing the weather app with location, temperature, and conditions) as:
   `screenshots/main-weather.png`

2. Save the second screenshot (showing the forecast section) as:
   `screenshots/forecast.png`

3. The screenshots should be PNG files with good resolution.

4. After saving the screenshots, commit them to the repository:
   ```
   git add screenshots/
   git commit -m "Add application screenshots for documentation"
   git push origin main
   ```

5. The README.md file will now display the screenshots properly.
